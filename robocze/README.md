# Classification project: Attrition
# Author: Agnieszka Kibitlewska

# Project Description:
* The aim of this project is to predict employee attrition in a company based on various factors such as demographic features, salary, job satisfaction, duration of employment, etc.
* The input data is provided in the following files: "attrition.csv", "df1.csv", and "df2.csv".
* "attrition.csv": This file contains the target class/label and employee identifiers (EmployeeNumber). The EmployeeNumber column is used to merge data from different files.
* "df1.csv" and "df2.csv": These files contain the features and employee identifiers (EmployeeNumber). Both files contain data for the same set of employees but have different features.

* df1 and df2 files need to be merged to incorporate all the features for the task. After merging the data, it needs to be split into a training and test set based on the "test_target.csv" file.

* The test data is provided in the "test_target.csv" file.
